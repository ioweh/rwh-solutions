given a list of points, like this one:

[Point 0 1, Point 2 2, Point 3 4] etc

we should sort them on the angle they make with the x-axis

import Data.List		-- to import `sort` function
import Data.Function		-- to import `on` function

:t on

guess the function from its signature:

on :: (b -> b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> a -> c
f `on` g = \x y -> f (g x) (g y)

((==) `on` (+3)) 3 4

Looks we need to use the `sortBy` function

sortBy (compare `on` \(Point x1 y1) (Point x2 y2) -> x1*x2 + y1*y2)) -- calculate dot product here
